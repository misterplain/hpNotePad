# HP Store Post-Sales Notepad

This is a productivity tool I've made for myself and my team. It has a productivity tracker (shift up and shift down to increase/decrease number underneath toolbar), a daily API call to display dashboard data, various pages containing small templates, and a more involved Templates section to dynamically create email replies on the fly.

The deployed site can be found [HERE](https://hpnotepad.onrender.com/)

Due to the usage limitations of Render and Cyclic, where I've hosted the Node.js backends for various projects, the backend code for this project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/misterplain/activeServer)

The code for version 1 of this project can be found [HERE](https://github.com/misterplain/hpNotePad/tree/9728a68fb34802168db68cebda4070e406bddce5)

Any and all feedback on this project is welcome, you may contact me [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-o-brien-6743b044/)!
